When you have a function with more than one parameter with the same type, use an object parameter instead of positional parameters:

```ts
// BAD
const addUserToPost = (userId: string, postId: string) => {};

// GOOD
const addUserToPost = (opts: { userId: string; postId: string }) => {};
```

Anything marked as a service by the name of the file, for instance, auth-token-service.ts, should have tests written for them in an accompanying .test.ts file.
